## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Evidence! 

*(You get to make just ONE joke â€” choose wisely)*

I'm a 2024 Software Engineering graduate from Ontario Tech University with a focus on Backend Development and Machine Learning. I work on building scalable APIs, automating intelligent systems, and deploying production-ready solutions.

My latest project is an AI-powered job matching system that parses resumes, ranks jobs semantically, and generates GPT-based recommendations.
You can find it â€” and more â€” right here on my GitHub.

ðŸ“¬ I'm currently open to backend or ML-focused roles â€” let's connect!
